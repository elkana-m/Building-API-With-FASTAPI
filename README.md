Using FAST API to build an API
-------------------------------

FAST API framework is a python library for building APIs. It uses a lightning-fast asynchronous service gateway interface (ASGI) server called Uvicorn Http server. It is easy to to learn and fast to implement your code.
The project is straight forward. I simply have a user as my model with the appropriate properties. To data storage of this simple app, I didn't use a real database, but a mock  database. I built Http method for the client to send requests. 

Http methods used: get, post, delete
